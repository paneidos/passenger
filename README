== Introduction

Phusion Passenger probably requires no introduction. We kindly refer the reader
to http://www.modrails.com/ for general information.

== Changes from Phusion Passenger ==

=== Defining other ruby versions ===

In your server config specify the following as many times as you like:
PassengerRubyAlt name executable

name = A name for this interpreter, to be used later as a shortcut.
executable = The full path to the ruby executable you want to register.

=== Choosing a ruby version ===

Specify the following in your <VirtualHost>, .htaccess, <Location>, <Directory>:
PassengerSelectRuby ruby

ruby = The short name given in the PassengerRubyAlt directive OR
        The full path to one of the ruby executables specified in
        PassengerRuby or PassengerRubyAlt directives OR
        "default" for the default ruby executable.
If the chosen ruby is not registered in the server configuration,
the default ruby executable is used.

=== Example ===

httpd.conf:
PassengerRuby /usr/bin/rubyee18
PassengerRubyAlt rubyee18 /usr/bin/rubyee18
PassengerRubyAlt ruby18 /usr/bin/ruby18
PassengerRubyAlt ruby19 /usr/bin/ruby19
PassengerRubyAlt new /usr/bin/ruby19

The last two directives don't cause Passenger to load /usr/bin/ruby19 twice,
instead it just registers two short names.
The same applies to the first two lines.

virtualhost:
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName test.passenger.rubyee18
    PassengerSelectRuby /usr/bin/rubyee18
</VirtualHost>

.htaccess:
PassengerSelectRuby ruby19

=== Limitations ===

* There is no directive yet to allow non-specified ruby executables.
* The will be no SpawnManager active until the first rails application is loaded.
* nginx is not supported yet.

== Installation

=== Regular installation

You can install either Phusion Passenger for Apache or for Nginx. Run either of
the following programs as root:

 ./bin/passenger-install-apache2-module

-OR-

 ./bin/passenger-install-nginx-module

That's it. :)

For troubleshooting, configuration and tips, please read the corresponding
Users Guide:

 doc/Users guide Apache.html
 doc/Users guide Nginx.html

These files are included in the source tarball, and may also be viewed online on
our website.

=== Installing via a gem

You may also first generate a .gem file, and then install that.
First, make sure that you have the following software installed:
- Doxygen: http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/
- Asciidoc: http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/

Next, run:

 rake package

The gem will be available under the 'pkg' folder.
